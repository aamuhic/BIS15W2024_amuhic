```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

1. load the data
```{r}
fish <- readr::read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```
2. transform `fish` data to only include 2 variables: lakeid and length
```{r}
fishlength <- select(fish, "lakeid", "length")
fishlength
```
* only use `data.frame` if you're working with raw data - don't need to here since `fish` is already a data frame..

3. filter `fish` for fish from lake BO
```{r}
bo_fish <- filter(fish, lakeid == "BO")
bo_fish
```
* might be better to categorize as factor: `fish$lakeid <- as.factor(fish$lakeid)` before you filter

4. what is the mean length of fish from lake BO?
```{r}
mean(bo_fish$length)
```
